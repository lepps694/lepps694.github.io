	These images were taken from the first apartment in NYC that I live in. In fact, it was my first apartment which is why it is even more memorable. The lighting inside was so pretty at certain times of the day and I took so many pictures of it. I never really had an opportunity to post them. I take photos if I feel like something looks pretty, and then I decide if I want to post them. These I guess eneded up just for my memories.
