	<div class="section2">
		<img src="imgs/view.jpg">
		<p>On this day, I went to dinner with my family and some friends. It was in Brooklyn and it was my first time(that I can remember) dning at a French restaurant. It was beautiful and at the top they had a bar which had stunning views of Manhattan.</p>

	<div class="section3">
		<img src="imgs/food.jpg">
		<p>We ordered many dishes and shared them. In this photo we have the appatizers. It was my first time trying escargot and it was quite good, kinda like mussels or something. There was also some smoked eel which was deliciously flavorful. The other two are cacio e peppe orzo rice and a salad. </p>

	<div class="section4">

		<p>I forgot to take a picture of the main course, which is why we have skipped to the dessert in this next photo. This one I also forgot to take pictures of so the dish is already been mixed around. For the main course, we had stake frites and chicken which was amazing. For dessert, we had profiteroles and banana pudding cake. These were soooo good-especially the cake which was like a steamed sponge cake.</p>

		<p>Lastly, there is a picture of a sign that I took in the taxi on my way back home. The evening was wonderful! I took these photos in hopes of posting on Instagram but I never did. It never seems like a good time to post during the dinner, and afterwards I spent time talking to my roommate that I forgot. It felt weird to post them the next day because it seemed late. I originally intended to take photos for my roommate who couldn't come and I gave her the same explanation as I wrote here.</p>
