<h1>"Rainy Day"</h1>

<div class="section">
<p>On this rainy day, I decided to visit the Guggenheim where they were showing Alex Katz work. I took many pictures, but I was especially drawn to the portraits he painted of his wife Ada throughout the years. There is something so beautiful to see him paint her at different stages of her life, and in a way it gave the exhibition a timeline.</p>
