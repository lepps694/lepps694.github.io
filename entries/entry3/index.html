	I spent a lot of time at cafes when I was in Finland in the Spring of 2022. On this particular day, I decided to go cafe hopping and visited one in the morning and one in the afternoon after my walk. These images are from that day. I think that I didn't post these because I had already posted something about a cafe that day and didn't want to be repetetive.
